# Hello, world!
- I'm a programmer who focuses on python but every once in a while, tries something new.
- I'm natively English
- I've worked on a lot of projects; mainly personal.
- I do use repositories, but most of mine are private ;-; sorry

One day I'll update my profile more but for now...
no
